# Collage
Takes one image and breaks it up into several smaller images that can be printed and re-combined on a wall.

The source image does not have to match the final size, the program will size accordingly.

Collage is designed to work with 13" x 19" paper.

The input image should be the same dimensions as the target output.  Some pages will need to be physically cropped. Each page has tiny guides on the corners to show where it should be cut. 

Placing the printed pages on the wall isn't easy especially when you get more than 4 across and down, but it's rewarding when you have a 6" poster on your wall.  Work your way from the center outwards using the built in guides to help.  Use clear tape to help hold them in place and tack.
