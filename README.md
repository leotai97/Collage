# Collage
Takes one image and breaks it up into several smaller images that can be printed and re-combined on a wall.

The source image does not have to match the final size exactly, the program will size accordingly.

Collage is designed to work with 13" x 19" paper.

The input image should be the same aspect as the target output. If you want a 2 x 3 poster using the landscape option then the input image should be some derivitive of 38 x 39, most likely 3800 x 3900.

across = 38"
down = 39"

Some of the printed pages will need to be physically cropped. Each page has tiny guides on the corners to show where it should be cut. The upper left and left edges will not need cropped, the lower right edges also will not need cropped.  Only the right and bottom edges will need cropped on each page because the top left will be hidden.

Placing the printed pages on the wall isn't easy especially when you get more than 4 across and down, but it's rewarding when you have a 6" poster on your wall.  Work your way from the center outwards using the built in guides to help.  Use clear tape to help hold them in place and tack.
